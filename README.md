 I learned a lot through completing this small project. I wanted to create something small and practical that incorporated javascript. After messing with DOM manipulation for the first time, I keep thinking of all the possibilities. This was a code along project that I didn't originally comeup with. Along the way I wrote code and refered to the video to check my work.
